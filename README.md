# Nombank_partitive_tasks

This project is a extension of work done as part of an  NLP class group project for at NYU under Prof. Adam Meyers. 
Please refer https://github.com/TAbishekS/Nombank-Tasks-Baseline-System as a reference. 

We incorpate parse tree based heuristic path features and evaluate their ulity in the prediction of semantic role labels for Nombank.

The build_model file will create a set of input features in the percentage and part folders. We will add parse tree based features and heuristic based features to enhance our input space. 
For the compressed feature dictionary or access to a google drive/ colab environment, mail as14634@nyu.edu. 

The notebooks will demonstrate the creation, training and evaluation of models for the %/partitive tasks. We experiment with adaboost and logisitic regression.
